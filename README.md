# Log4j-Example

Write an interactive simple calculator. The user can enter a number [integer, floating point] or an operator [+,-,*,/,%]. It simple performs the operation on the next operand and the previously entered result. Also, it keeps a track of all the inputs given by the user and the last computed result till the user enters ‘C’ (clear) or ‘E’ (exit). The program should appropriately handle error conditions and show corresponding errors, warnings and info. The console output should not show DEBUG but the file output should.
